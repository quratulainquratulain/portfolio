        <p>
          A classic Hangman game built with Python. The program selects a random
          word, and the player attempts to guess it letter by letter within a
          limited number of attempts. It provides feedback on correct and incorrect
          guesses, displays the current state of the word, and shows a win/loss
          message at the end.
